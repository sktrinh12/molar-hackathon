# Thousands of Genes
## This is a project for the Acceleration Consortium Hackaton, hosted by the University of Toronto

## It consist of a streamlit web app that makes use of [Molar chemistry database API](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/molar) to create a GUI interface in an attempt to help scientists save experimental data easier. The public dataset was borrowed from [Nanostring](https://www.nanostring.com/) that includes GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler for tissue analysis. Part of a hackathon hosted by Acceleration Consortium.

To use this you need MOLAR, streamlit, pandas and plotly. To install you can do the following:




```
pip instal streamlit pandas plotly molar
streamlit run app.py
 ```
